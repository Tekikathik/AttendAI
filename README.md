I developed an Automatic Face Attendance System that detects multiple faces at the same time and marks attendance using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model.
My system recognizes only registered faces and ignores unknown faces, which helps prevent proxy attendance.

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to make attendance more secure, accurate, and fully automatic.

🔥 What My Project Does

I detect multiple faces in real time using a camera

I use a CNN model to recognize faces accurately

I mark attendance only for trained and authorized users

I ignore unknown faces to avoid proxy attendance

I automatically save attendance records
